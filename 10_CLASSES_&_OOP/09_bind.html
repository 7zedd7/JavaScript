    What is bind?
        The bind method in JavaScript creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to a specific value. This allows you to control what this refers to inside that function, regardless of how or where the function is called.

    Why Use bind?
        In JavaScript, the value of this depends on how a function is called. This can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, especially in event handlers or callbacks. Using bind ensures that this has the correct reference, typically an instance of a class or a specific object. -->
