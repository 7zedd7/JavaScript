# Javascript and classes

# OOP

-OOP was developed to make code more flexible and easier to maintain.

    JavaScript is prototype-based procedural language, which means it supports both functional and object-oriented programming.

## Class_Based and Prototype _based language

### Class-based :

    Uses predefined classes as blueprints for creating objects, making the code more structured and consistent. Languages like Java, C++, and Python are examples of class-based programming.

### Prototype-based :

    Creates objects directly and allows for more flexibility by cloning existing objects and adding properties and methods. JavaScript is an example of a prototype-based language.

# Object
- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

# why use OOP

    Using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript enhances code modularity, reusability, and maintainability by organizing related properties and methods into classes and objects. It supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which streamline code management, improve readability, and allow for scalable and flexible design. OOP also facilitates the use of design patterns and aligns well with many popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries, making it easier to build complex, robust applications.

## parts of OOP

- Object literal 
- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)


## 4 pillars
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
